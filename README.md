System Requirements
	1.	Operating System: The script is compatible with:
	•	Windows 10 or later
	•	macOS Catalina or later
	•	Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04 or later)
	2.	Python Version:
	•	Python 3.8 or later is required.
	3.	Google Chrome:
	•	Install the latest version of Google Chrome.

	•	Download the appropriate version of ChromeDriver corresponding to your Chrome version from ChromeDriver official website.
	5.	Hardware:
	•	At least 4 GB of RAM.
	•	A stable internet connection for web scraping.

Required Python Libraries

Install the following Python libraries before running the script:
	•	selenium: For browser automation.
	•	logging: For runtime logs (built-in with Python).
	•	json: For data serialization (built-in with Python).
	•	datetime: For timestamps (built-in with Python).

To install the required library, use:

pip install selenium

Setting Up a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies and avoid conflicts.

On Windows:
	1.	Open the command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
	2.	Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv


	3.	Activate the virtual environment:

venv\Scripts\activate



On macOS/Linux:
	1.	Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
	2.	Create a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv


	3.	Activate the virtual environment:

source venv/bin/activate


	4.	Install the required library within the virtual environment:

pip install selenium

Setting Up ChromeDriver
	1.	Download ChromeDriver:
	•	Visit ChromeDriver Downloads.
	•	Select the version matching your installed Google Chrome.
	2.	Add ChromeDriver to PATH:
	•	On Windows:
	•	Extract the ChromeDriver .exe file to a folder.
	•	Add the folder path to the system’s PATH environment variable.
	•	On macOS/Linux:
	•	Extract the file and move it to /usr/local/bin or any directory in your PATH.
	3.	Test Installation:
Run the following command to verify ChromeDriver is correctly installed:

chromedriver --version

Running the Script
	1.	Clone or download the script to your local machine.
	2.	Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the script directory.
	3.	Activate the virtual environment (if set up).
	4.	Run the script:

python script_name.py


	5.	Follow the on-screen prompts:
	•	Enter the ChatGPT conversation URL.
	•	Choose the save format (txt or json).
	•	Provide a file name for saving the extracted data (or leave blank to print to the console).

Specific Instructions for Different Systems

On Windows:
	1.	Ensure Python is installed and added to PATH.
	2.	Install the libraries and set up ChromeDriver as outlined above.
	3.	Use venv\Scripts\activate to activate the virtual environment.

On macOS/Linux:
	1.	Ensure Python 3 is installed (use python3 command).
	2.	Install libraries using pip3 if necessary.
	3.	Use source venv/bin/activate to activate the virtual environment.

Common Issues and Fixes
	1.	ChromeDriver Version Mismatch:
	•	Ensure ChromeDriver matches your installed Google Chrome version. Update Chrome or ChromeDriver if needed.
	2.	Permission Errors:
	•	On macOS/Linux, ensure ChromeDriver has executable permissions:

chmod +x /path/to/chromedriver


	3.	Missing Libraries:
	•	If the script fails due to missing libraries, install them using:

pip install selenium


	4.	Timeouts:
	•	If the page takes longer to load, increase the time.sleep() duration in the script.

Verifying Functionality

After running the script:
	•	Check the scraper.log file for execution logs.
	•	Verify the extracted data in the specified output file or console output.

By following these steps, you can ensure smooth execution of the script on your system.
